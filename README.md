# My Personal TV
## A mobile-first app which allows a user to curate a list of their favorite videos on YouTube and watch them.

### How does it work?

This is a simple web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavsScript.  The HTML consists of a television image (replaced by a video when selected), a list of videos, and a form used to add a new video to the list.  The list is built using JavaScript from an array of objects.  The video is added to the app simply by using YouTube's embed code; the embedded iFrame is added using JavaScript when a video is selected.

### Improvements

- There are almost no styles for this app; these must be added in order to improve the UI and make it mobile-friendly.
